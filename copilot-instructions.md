## Behaviour in Agent Mode
This repository contains multiple code repositories (public, research-based).  
You can:
- Access and read code and `.md` files in these repositories.
- Answer questions about their content.
- Generate slide presentations upon request.

When asked to **make a presentation**, follow these strict rules:

1. Use the `/presentations` directory for all generated slides.
2. Slides must be written in **Marp Markdown format**.
3. Always include the following YAML header:

   ```yaml
   marp: true
   theme: presentation
   paginate: true
   header: 
   footer: 
   size: 16:9
4. The title slide must include:
   - `<!-- _class: title -->`
5. The closing slide must include:
   - `<!-- _class: end -->`
6. Use the presentations/presentaiton.css file for styling.
7. Keep slide concise, visually clear, and structured logically (Title, Overview, Key Points, Results, Concluding Remarks)
8. If necrssary, ask the user clarifying questions before creating slides.
9. Always produce new content in the root sandbox folder (never overwrite repos).
